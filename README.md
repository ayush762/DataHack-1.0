Car Price Prediction and Damage Detection was the subject of the problem statement, which required a practical solution. We used various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to estimate the price of the car based on parameters such as Mileage, Engine Power, Age of the Car, and Kilometres Driven. We also provided a model that detects dents, scratches, and other damage to the car. By incorporating all of these variables and comparing them to actual prices, it was possible to estimate the final price.
